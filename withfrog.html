          I designed the mobile application Pause at a Mental Hackathon. The prompt of the  Hackathon is to create a product that supports mental health. I am an avid supporter of  talk therapy and meditative breathing. I wanted to make these two tactics as accessible  as possible because mental health events are often triggered in fast-paced events. I  designed the app so that the loading page invites the user to slow his/her breathe. The  user can accept this invitation by holding down the blue circle which will then expand  and shrink creating a visual that mimics breathing that guides the user in meditative  breathing. Otherwise the user can swipe left to log and analyze their thoughts and  feelings. The page marker tells the user how many questions are left so the user does  not feel overwhelmed. The user can swipe up and down to access new and old questions,  or he/she can swipe right or left to access another function: analytical prompts,  meditative breathing, past logs. My biggest concern was making this app as intuitive  and simple as possible. The user is someone who is in distress. Any inconvenience will  worsen his/her mental experience and discourage him/her from using the app. This is  why I decided to use one color palette, spaced out icons, bifunctional swipes (right/left  to switch between functions, up/down to further engage with the function), and  enlarged text. I also hope to implement a word parser that is able to detect the words  that are most commonly used in the user logs. This information lets the user know if  he/she fixates on certain words or is prone to certain feelings for certain reasons. And  analysis of such data can reveal trends in emotions and events, and thus lead to  awareness, the first and most important step in healing.

          This is a personal project that I designed over the summer because I wanted to make  traveling a more fun, informed, and safe experience. Given the nature of being in an  environment you are not familiar with, traveling is often stressful and even dangerous.  The main purpose of Tripper is to give travelers easy access to important information. 
           <br>
          Similar to Yelp, Tripper allows users to rate and comment on travel locations (e.g.  hotels, travel groups, events, tourist attractions, local restaurants). Users can build an  itinerary and search up locations and find places and events to attend in or around  where they currently are or somewhere they wish to visit. In order to ensure validity of  comments and suggestions of users, other users are also able to “like” and “dislike”  suggestions. Users will have a profile where they can share their travel experiences and  places they have visited. This helps ensure credibility to suggestions. For example  before Liana follows Kodiak’s advice to bring bug nets to Yosemite, Liana can check  Kodiak’s profile to see if Kodiak has been to Yosemite. Users can also check into places  using mobile location to increase credibility. Because safe traveling relies on sensitive  information, I designed the functions of Tripper to prioritize ensuring that the most  helpful suggestions and comments rise to the top.

      <div>
       I designed ParkFast at HackMobility where they prompted me to design a product that  would facilitate transportation. Living in Berkeley I know first-hand how difficult it is  to find parking. My solution is an app that connects people with parking spaces and  people who need parking spaces. Users are able to list their parking space and rent it  out when they don’t use it (e.g. during work). Other users are able to find either parking  spaces for rent around them, parking garages around them (using HERE API), or street  parking. This gives users the option of either paying for secured parking spaces or  getting help finding free parking. Using location data of the user population, the app is  able to detect when a user leaves a parking spot, then suggest to nearby users that there  might be a parking spot where the other user just left. I included how long ago the other  user left, and the time it would take to drive to the parking space so that users can make  well-informed choices about where to find parking. To help listers make well-informed  choices on how much they should price their listing, the app makes a suggestion based  upon the prices of parking spaces around them with similar parking amenities (indoors,  charger, etc.) and well as the demand for parking spots in that area.

        The prompt of the design sprint is “Design for a Better Berkeley.” The user problem I  tackled is the lack of knowledge about available study spaces on campus. Especially  during midterm or final season, popular spaces like Moffit Library of MLK are filled  with people. I utilized the fact that most study spaces on Campus require students show  their IDs or check in. Though an additional system that swipes in and out students  needs to be implemented, the website shows how much space is occupied compared to  the total space available. Additional information that I have implemented is the hours of  the building, the amenities available in the building (charger plugs, computers for rent,  food, nap pods), the type of space (indoors, outdoors, both). By providing easy access to  information, I hope to help students efficiently find a place where they can study.  Berkeley will also be able to benefit because campus space will be better allocated, and  people will be knowledgeably spread out.

        With my Innovative Design Web Team, I designed and coded a website for Queer Trans  South Asians at Berkeley. We designed the website with their purpose in mind, 1) to  bring awareness about their club 2) to educate about LGBTQ issues 3) to share LGBTQ  events and individuals 4) to share resources for the LGBTQ community.
