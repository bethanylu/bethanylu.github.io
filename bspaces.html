        The prompt of the design sprint is “Design for a Better Berkeley.” The user problem I  tackled is the lack of knowledge about available study spaces on campus. Especially  during midterm or final season, popular spaces like Moffit Library of MLK are filled  with people. I utilized the fact that most study spaces on Campus require students show  their IDs or check in. Though an additional system that swipes in and out students  needs to be implemented, the website shows how much space is occupied compared to  the total space available. Additional information that I have implemented is the hours of  the building, the amenities available in the building (charger plugs, computers for rent,  food, nap pods), the type of space (indoors, outdoors, both). By providing easy access to  information, I hope to help students efficiently find a place where they can study.  Berkeley will also be able to benefit because campus space will be better allocated, and  people will be knowledgeably spread out.
