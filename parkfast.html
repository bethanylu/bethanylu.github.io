       I designed ParkFast at HackMobility where they prompted me to design a product that  would facilitate transportation. Living in Berkeley I know first-hand how difficult it is  to find parking. My solution is an app that connects people with parking spaces and  people who need parking spaces. Users are able to list their parking space and rent it  out when they don’t use it (e.g. during work). Other users are able to find either parking  spaces for rent around them, parking garages around them (using HERE API), or street  parking. This gives users the option of either paying for secured parking spaces or  getting help finding free parking. Using location data of the user population, the app is  able to detect when a user leaves a parking spot, then suggest to nearby users that there  might be a parking spot where the other user just left. I included how long ago the other  user left, and the time it would take to drive to the parking space so that users can make  well-informed choices about where to find parking. To help listers make well-informed  choices on how much they should price their listing, the app makes a suggestion based  upon the prices of parking spaces around them with similar parking amenities (indoors,  charger, etc.) and well as the demand for parking spots in that area.
