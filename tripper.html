            This is a personal project that I designed over the summer because I wanted to make  traveling a more fun, informed, and safe experience. Given the nature of being in an  environment you are not familiar with, traveling is often stressful and even dangerous.  The main purpose of Tripper is to give travelers easy access to important information. 
             <br>
            Similar to Yelp, Tripper allows users to rate and comment on travel locations (e.g.  hotels, travel groups, events, tourist attractions, local restaurants). Users can build an  itinerary and search up locations and find places and events to attend in or around  where they currently are or somewhere they wish to visit. In order to ensure validity of  comments and suggestions of users, other users are also able to “like” and “dislike”  suggestions. Users will have a profile where they can share their travel experiences and  places they have visited. This helps ensure credibility to suggestions. For example  before Liana follows Kodiak’s advice to bring bug nets to Yosemite, Liana can check  Kodiak’s profile to see if Kodiak has been to Yosemite. Users can also check into places  using mobile location to increase credibility. Because safe traveling relies on sensitive  information, I designed the functions of Tripper to prioritize ensuring that the most  helpful suggestions and comments rise to the top.
