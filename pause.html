          I designed the mobile application Pause at a Mental Hackathon. The prompt of the  Hackathon is to create a product that supports mental health. I am an avid supporter of  talk therapy and meditative breathing. I wanted to make these two tactics as accessible  as possible because mental health events are often triggered in fast-paced events. I  designed the app so that the loading page invites the user to slow his/her breathe. The  user can accept this invitation by holding down the blue circle which will then expand  and shrink creating a visual that mimics breathing that guides the user in meditative  breathing. Otherwise the user can swipe left to log and analyze their thoughts and  feelings. The page marker tells the user how many questions are left so the user does  not feel overwhelmed. The user can swipe up and down to access new and old questions,  or he/she can swipe right or left to access another function: analytical prompts,  meditative breathing, past logs. My biggest concern was making this app as intuitive  and simple as possible. The user is someone who is in distress. Any inconvenience will  worsen his/her mental experience and discourage him/her from using the app. This is  why I decided to use one color palette, spaced out icons, bifunctional swipes (right/left  to switch between functions, up/down to further engage with the function), and  enlarged text. I also hope to implement a word parser that is able to detect the words  that are most commonly used in the user logs. This information lets the user know if  he/she fixates on certain words or is prone to certain feelings for certain reasons. And  analysis of such data can reveal trends in emotions and events, and thus lead to  awareness, the first and most important step in healing.
